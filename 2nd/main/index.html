He was a serious man who stood up for what he believed was right, no matter the circumstance. A simple serious outfit represents his seriousness and lack of care for modernity when it comes to his day-to-day life. But not too serious. Psst, he hates men in white shirts.</p>

        <p class="poem">
          In a kingdom, worn and weary, sat old Lear upon his throne, A crown of
          thorns upon his head, in regal robes, alone. His kingdom, once a
          beacon bright, now shadows creeping near, For folly's hand had gripped
          the heart of aging King Lear. Three daughters, like three fates, did
          weave their father’s tragic lore, Goneril and Regan, hearts of stone,
          ambition in their core. Cordelia, the youngest, true, her love she did
          not dress, But simple words, the truth did speak, earned banishment no
          less.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="stanza2" class="stanza">
        <p class="poem">
          "Divide my realm," the old king cried, "to she who loves me most,
          Proclaim your love, and win your share, let flattery be your host."
          The elder sisters spun their tales, deceit as their design, While
          Cordelia's silence spoke of love, pure, undressed, divine. A kingdom
          split, a father fooled by sweetened, poisoned words, Lear’s eyes, by
          pride and age concealed, saw not the looming swords. Goneril and
          Regan’s plots unfold, as power was their aim, While Lear, a puppet
          king, danced in their cruel and heartless game.

          The storm did rage, both in his heart and on the heath so wild, A
          king, now mad, his realm in ruins, lost and beguiled. His fool, his
          shadow, spoke in riddles, truths that kings despise, Yet in his folly
          Lear found sense, beneath the tempest skies. A tragedy of errors, his
          daughters' hearts revealed, Betrayed and broken, left to wander, his
          fate was sealed. Cordelia’s arms, though open, came too late to mend,
          The fractured bonds, the kingdom's woes, a family’s bitter end.

        <p class="poem">
          Oh, Lear, a king not by wisdom, but by lineage and by name, A father,
          flawed, whose legacy was naught but grief and shame. In Shakespeare’s
          tome, a lesson scribed in tears and tempest ink, Beware the hollow
          flattery that makes a kingdom sink.

        Here lies King Lear, a sovereign lost in pride,
A father undone by flattery, his kingdom did divide.
A fool by his throne, yet wisdom came too late,
Lear's tragic end, a lesson wrought by fate.
